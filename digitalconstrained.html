	<h1>Constrained Writing with Blockly</h1>
	<h2>by Tina Quach for <a href="http://nickm.com/classes/the_word_made_digital/2017_spring/">CMS.609 Word Made Digital</a></h2>
	<br>
	In this project, I aimed to explore how the <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/">Blockly visual programming interface</a> can be repurposed to create constrained writing experiences. I created custom blocks using text pulled from <a href="http://ohsarahkay.tumblr.com/originstory">a transcript</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esgfG3BoAPc">Sarah Kay and Phil Kaye's spoken word performance of "An Origin Story"</a>.
	<p style="font-weight:bold">Click <a href="digitalconstrained/index.html">here</a> to check out the result.</p>
	The program enforces the following constraints:
	<ul>
		<li>The title must be "An Origin Story".</li>
		<li>There must be 7 lines of dialogue.</li>
		<li>There can be a maximum of two named people in the story, and their name must be Phil or Sarah.</li>
		<li>Possible speech is limited to combinations of the same speech blocks.</li>
		<li>Once something is added to the writing (represented by the workspace), it can not be deleted--only hidden.</li>
	</ul>
	I'd like to build on this project by allowing users to input their own texts, and giving them a constrained writing experience that draws from that body of text. This could use semantic analysis to determine what block shapes would make sense for representing specific words and phrases.
