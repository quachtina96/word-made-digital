	<h1>Feeding Email Bots</h1>
  <h3>"You are what you eat!" - Somebody</h3>
	<h2>by Tina Quach for <a href="http://nickm.com/classes/the_word_made_digital/2017_spring/">CMS.609 Word Made Digital</a></h2>

    <p> Last week, I implemented <a href="email_terminal.py"><span style="font-weight: bold">Jay, an email assistant for MIT Students</span></a> as my interactive text. The feedback given, inspired my next undertaking in which Jay is still your email assistant. However, instead of helping your manage your MIT mail, Jay is helping you raise your emailbots! Emailbots start off as crying babies that you can't really interact with. They eat emails, and after you've fed them enough, they can begin to share their writing with you! For these emailbots, emails are not only culturally informative, but also very delicious. Try raising your own with the python script below! </p> 

    <p>Note that this script will request access to your gmail account. Take a better look at the code for verification of trustworthiness.</p>
